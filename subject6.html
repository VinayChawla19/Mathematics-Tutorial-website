<h1 align="center">Lines and angles</h1>
<p>Here are some basic definitions and properties of lines and angles in geometry.</p>
<ul>
<li><b>Line segment</b>: A line segment has two end points with a definite length.</li>

<li><b>Ray</b>:A ray has one end point and infinitely extends in one direction.</li>
<img src="images/ray.gif" width="350px" height="100px" alt="lines"></br></br>
<li><b>Straight line</b>:A straight line has neither starting nor end point and is of infinite length.</li>
<img src="images/straight-line.gif" width="350px" height="100px" alt="lines"></br></br>
<li><b>Acute angle</b>: The angle that is between 0° and 90° is an acute angle, ?A in the figure below.</li>
<img src="images/acute-angle.gif" width="350px" height="200px" alt="lines"></br></br>
<li><b>Obtuse angle</b>: The angle that is between 90° and 180° is an obtuse angle, ?B as shown below.</li>

<li><b>Right angle</b>: The angle that is 90° is a Right angle, ?C as shown below.</li>

<li><b>Supplemenrary angles</b></li>
<img src="images/supplementary-angles.gif" width="250px" height="200px" alt="lines"></br></br>
In the figure above, AOC + COB = AOB = 180°

If the sum of two angles is 180° then the angles are called supplementary angles.

Two right angles always supplement each other.

The pair of adjacent angles whose sum is a straight angle is called a linear pair.</br></br>
<li><b>Complementary angles:</b></li></br>
<img src="images/complementary-angles.gif" width="250px" height="200px" alt="lines"></br>
COA + AOB = 90°

If the sum of two angles is 90° then the two angles are called complementary angles.
</br>
<li><b>Adjacent angles:</b></li></br>
The angles that have a common arm and a common vertex are called adjacent angles.

In the figure above, BOA and AOC are adjacent angles. Their common arm is OA and common vertex is ‘O’.</br>

<li><b>Perpendicular lines</b>: When there is a right angle between two lines, the lines are said to be perpendicular to each other.Here, the lines OA and OB are said to be perpendicular to each other.</br>
<img src="images/perpendicular-lines.gif" width="250px" height="200px" alt="lines"></br></br>
<li><b>Parallel lines:</b></li>
<img src="images/parallel-lines.gif" width="250px" height="200px" alt="lines"></br>
Here, A and B are two parallel lines, intersected by a line p.

The line p is called a transversal, that which intersects two or more lines (not necessarily parallel lines) at distinct points.

As seen in the figure above, when a transversal intersects two lines, 8 angles are formed.
</ul>
<ul>
<p>When a transversal intersects two parallel lines
<li>The corresponding angles are equal.</li>
<li>The vertically opposite angles are equal.</li>
<li>The alternate interior angles are equal.</li>
<li>The alternate exterior angles are equal.</li>
<li>The pair of interior angles on the same side of the transversal is supplementary.</li></br>
We can say that the lines are parallel if we can verify at least one of the aforementioned conditions.</p>
</ul>

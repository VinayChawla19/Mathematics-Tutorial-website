<h2>What are rational numbers ?</h2>
<p>A rational number is a number that can be expressed as a fraction p/q where p and q are integers and q!=0. A rational number p/q is said to have numerator p and denominator q. Numbers that are not rational are called irrational numbers. The real line consists of the union of the rational and irrational numbers. The set of rational numbers is of measure zero on the real line, so it is "small" compared to the irrationals and the continuum.

The set of all rational numbers is referred to as the "rationals," and forms a field that is denoted Q. Here, the symbol  Q derives from the German word Quotient, which can be translated as "ratio," and first appeared in Bourbaki's Algèbre (reprinted as Bourbaki 1998, p. 671).

Any rational number is trivially also an algebraic number.

Examples of rational numbers include -7, 0, 1, 1/2, 22/7, 12345/67, and so on. Farey sequences provide a way of systematically enumerating all rational numbers.

The set of rational numbers is denoted Rationals in the Wolfram Language, and a number  x can be tested to see if it is rational using the command Element[x, Rationals].

The elementary algebraic operations for combining rational numbers are exactly the same as for combining fractions.

It is always possible to find another rational number between any two members of the set of rationals. Therefore, rather counterintuitively, the rational numbers are a continuous set, but at the same time countable.</p>
<h2>Properties of rational numbers</h2>
<ul>
<p>Let us consider rational number p,q and r . The law holds good if it is true for addition and multiplication.</p>

<li><u>Associative law for rational numbers:</u></li></br> 
Additive law : (p + q) + r = p + (q + r)</br>

Multiplicative law : (p * q) * r = p * (q * r).</br></br>

<li><u>Commutative law for rational numbers:</li></u></br>
Additive law : p + q = q + p</li></br>

Multiplicative law : p * q = q * p </br></br>

<li><u>Identity for rational numbers:</u></li>
0 is the additive identity for rational numbers

i.e., p + 0 = p and

1 is the multiplication identity for rational numbers

i.e., p * 1 = p.
</ul>
<h2>List Of Rational Numbers</h2>
<ul>
<p>Rational numbers is a big subset of real number set which are not irrational. These are the numbers that can be represented in the form of Numerator/Denominator, such that both numerator and denominator are integers and the denominator of the fraction is not equivalent to zero. The list mentioned below is the list of rational numbers and their types.</br>
<li>Natural Numbers: The counting numbers that begin from 1 are called natural numbers. Example: 1, 2, 3, 4 …, 8</li></br>
<li>Whole Numbers: Natural numbers including zero are whole numbers. Example: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 …, 8</li></br>
<li>Integers: The whole set of Positive and Negative Numbers, such that that positive numbers are Natural Numbers and negative ones are their negation including zero are integers. Example: - 8, … - 4, - 3, - 2, - 2, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4 … 8. There are two types of integers, notable integers and named integers.</li></br>
<li>Cardinal Numbers: These are the rational numbers that are used to evaluate the size of a set. These are strictly natural numbers.</li></br>
<li>Prime Numbers: The numbers that have two divisors, 1 and the numbers themselves. Examples: 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, etc.</li></br>
<li>Perfect Numbers: Numbers that can be obtained by summing up all their proper divisors. Example: 6, 28, 496, etc.</li></br>
</ul>

<h2>Operations on Rational numbers</h2></br>
<h3>Adding rational numbers</h3>
<p>All the arithmetic operations can also be performed using the rational numbers.
For doing various operations, the rules used are same, but the numbers used is the rational numbers.

Adding Operations with Same Denominators

Example: 82 + 42

Solution: 82 + 42

= 8+42

= 122 = 6</p>
<h3>Subtracting rational numbers</h3>
<p>Just as we subtract fractions, we can subtract rational numbers with same denominator or with the different denominator.

Subtraction Operations with Same Denominators

Example : 56 - 26

Solution: 56 - 26

= 5-26

= 36

= 12
</p>
<h3>Multiplying Rational Numbers</h3>
<p>Just alike the multiplication of whole numbers and integers, multiplication of rational number are also repeated addition. When two numbers are multiplied, the numbers are called factors and result is the product.

Solved Examples
Question 1: 54 x 105
Solution:
 
54 x 105

= 5×104×5

= 5020

= 52

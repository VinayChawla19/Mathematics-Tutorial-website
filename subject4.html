<h1 align="center">What is triangle</h1>
<p> A triangle is a closed figure made up of three line segments.
A triangle consists of three line segments and three angles.
In the figure above, AB, BC, CA are the three line segments and A, B, C are the three angles.
There are three types of triangles based on sides and three based on angles.

<h2>Types of triangles based on sides</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>Equilateral triangle</b>: A triangle having all the three sides of equal length is an equilateral triangle.Since all sides are equal, all angles are equal too.</li></br>

<li><b>Isosceles triangle</b>: A triangle having two sides of equal length is an Isosceles triangle.The two angles opposite to the equal sides are equal.</li></br>

<li><b>Scalene triangle</b>: A triangle having three sides of different lengths is called a scalene triangle.</li></br>

</ul>
<h2>Types of triangles based on angles</h2>
<uL>
<li><b>Acute-angled triangle</b>: A triangle whose all angles are acute is called an acute-angled triangle or Acute triangle.</li></br>

<li><b>Obtuse-angled triangle</b>: A triangle whose one angle is obtuse is an obtuse-angled triangle or Obtuse triangle.</li></br>

<li><b>Right-angled triangle</b>: A triangle whose one angle is a right-angle is a Right-angled triangle or Right triangle.</li></br>

<p>In the figure above, the side opposite to the right angle, BC is called the hypotenuse.

For a Right triangle ABC,

BC2 = AB2 + AC2

This is called the Pythagorean Theorem.

In the triangle above, 52 = 42 + 32. Only a triangle that satisfies this condition is a right triangle.

Hence, the Pythagorean Theorem helps to find whether a triangle is Right-angled.
</ul>

<h3>Basic properties of triangles</h3>
<ul>
<p>
<li>The sum of the angles in a triangle is 180°. This is called the angle-sum property.</li>
<li>The sum of the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is greater than the length of the third side. Similarly, the difference between the lengths of any two sides of a triangle is less than the length of the third side.</li>
<li>The side opposite to the largest angle is the longest side of the triangle and the side opposite to the smallest angle is the shortest side of the triangle.</li></br>

<p>In the figure above, B is the largest angle and the side opposite to it (hypotenuse), is the largest side of the triangle</p>

<p>In the figure above, A is the largest angle and the side opposite to it, BC is the largest side of the triangle.</p>
<li>An exterior angle of a triangle is equal to the sum of its interior opposite angles. This is called the exterior angle property of a triangle.


Here, ACD is the exterior angle to the ABC.
According to the exterior angle property, ACD = CAB + ABC.</li>

<h1 align="center">Fractions And Decimals</h1>
<h2>Fractions</h2>
<ul>
<li>A fraction is a number representing a part of a whole. This whole
may be a single object or a group of objects.</li>
<li> A fraction whose numerator is less than the denominator is called a
proper fraction, otherwise it is called an improper fraction.</li>
<li> Numbers of the type
5 4 1 3 ,8 ,2
7 9 5 etc. are called mixed fractions
(numbers).</li>
<li> An improper fraction can be converted into a mixed fraction and
vice versa.</li>
<li> Fractions equivalent to a given fraction can be obtained by
multiplying or dividing its numerator and denominator by a nonzero
number</li>
<li> A fraction in which there is no common factor, except 1, in its
numerator and denominator is called a fraction in the simplest or
lowest form.</li>
<li> Fractions with same denominators are called like fractions and if
the denominators are different, then they are called unlike fractions.</li>
<li> Fractions can be compared by converting them into like fractions
and then arranging them in ascending or descending order.</li>
<li> Addition (or subtraction) of like fractions can be done by adding
(or subtracting) their numerators.</li>
<li> Addition (or subtraction) of unlike fractions can be done by
converting them into like fractions.</li>
<li> Fractions with denominators 10,100, etc. can be written in a form,
using a decimal point, called decimal numbers or decimals.</li>
<li> Decimal numbers can be compared using the idea of place value
and then can be arranged in ascending or descending order.</li>
<li> Decimals can be added (or subtracted) by writing them with equal
number of decimal places.</li>
<li> Many daily life problems can be solved by converting different units
of measurements such as money, length, weight, etc. in the decimal
form and then adding (or subtracting) them</li>
</ul>
<h3>Solved Examples</h3>
<p>Ex: Round off 87.952 to tenths place.</br>
Solution: For rounding off to tenths place, we look at the
hundredths place. Here the digit is 5.</br>
So, the digit at the tenths place (9) will be increased
by 1 (i.e., it will become 9 + 1)
Hence, rounding off 87.952 to tenths place, we get 88.0
(Note: Do not write it as 88.)</br></br>
Ex: What should be added to 37.28 to obtain 46.8?</br>
Solution: Here, we want to fill in the box in 37.28 + = 46.8.
For this, We will have to find 46.8 – 37.28. We perform
this operation as follows by writing the two numbers
having equal number of decimal places:
(Since 46.8 = 46.80)
Hence, the required number to be added
to 37.28 is 9.52.</br></br>
Ex: Arrange the following in ascending order.
2.2, 2.023, 2.0226, 22.1, 20.42</br>
Solution: We have to arrange them from the smallest to the greatest
number. We arrange them as follows (using the idea of
place value and comparing their digits at different places);
2.0226, 2.023, 2.2, 20.42, 22.1
(Note: Using the < sign, these numbers can also be written
as 2.0226 < 2.023 < 2.2 < 20.42 < 22.1</br></br>

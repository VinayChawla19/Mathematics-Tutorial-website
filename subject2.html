<h1 align="center">Integers</h1>
<p>Integers are whole numbers, for example, –4, –3, –2, –1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, ...

Positive integers are all the whole numbers greater than zero, ie: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ... We say that its sign is positive. Negative integers are all the whole numbers less than zero, ie: –1, –2, –3, –4, –5, ... We say that its sign is negative.

Integers extend infinitely in both positive and negative directions.

Zero is an integer that is neither positive nor negative.</p>
<h2 align="center">Consecutive Integers</h2></br>
<p>Consecutive integers are integers that follow in sequence, each number being 1 more than the previous number, for example 22, 23, 24, 25, ...

Consecutive integers can be more generally represented by n, n +1, n + 2, n + 3, ..., where n is any integer.</p>
<h2 align="center">Even and Odd Integer</h2></br>
<p>Even integers are integers that can be divided evenly by 2, for example, –4, –2, 0, 2, 4, ... An even integer always ends in 0, 2, 4, 6, or 8. Zero is considered an even integer.

Odd integers are integers that cannot be divided evenly by 2, for example, –5, –3, –1, 1, 3, 5, ... An odd integer always ends in 1, 3, 5, 7, or 9. 

To tell whether an integer is even or odd, look at the digit in the ones place. That single digit will tell you whether the entire integer is odd or even, for example the integer 3,255 is an odd integer because it ends in 5, an odd integer. Likewise, 702 is an even integer because it ends in 2.</p></br>

<h2 align="center">Some identities</h2></br>
<ul>
<li>Additive Identity: Adding 0 to any integer does not change the value of the integer.</li>
<li> Additive Inverse: Each integer has an opposing number (opposite sign). When you add a number and its additive inverse, you get 0.</li>
<li> The opposite of a negative is a positive.</li>
</ul>
